## API

### ConstantBeam

```
ConstantBeam <: BeamModel
```

In this beam model, the Jones matrix is assumed to be unity in every direction.

### DiagonalJonesMatrix

```
immutable DiagonalJonesMatrix
```

This type represents a Jones matrix that is diagonal.

These matrices are used to represent the complex gains of each antenna without accounting for the off-diagonal polarization leakage terms.

### GainCalibration

```
immutable GainCalibration <: Calibration
```

This type stores the information for calibrating the electronic gains of the interferometer. That is, it stores complex gains and flags for each antenna, frequency channel, and polarization.

```
GainCalibration(Nant, Nfreq)
```

Create a calibration table for `Nant` antennas with `Nfreq` frequency channels where all the gains are initially set to unity.

### HermitianJonesMatrix

```
immutable HermitianJonesMatrix
```

This type represents a Jones matrix that is Hermitian.

These matrices are useful for representing the $xx$, $xy$, $yx$, and $yy$ flux, because $xx$ and $yy$ are constrained to be real while $xy$ and $yx$ are complex conjugates.

### JonesMatrix

```
immutable JonesMatrix
```

This type represents a 2x2 complex Jones matrix.

\[ \begin{pmatrix}     j_{xx} & j_{xy} \\
    j_{yx} & j_{yy} \\
\end{pmatrix} \]

### MeasurementSet

```
immutable MeasurementSet
```

This type is a wrapper around `CasaCore.Tables.Table` that is intended to simplify most of the common interactions between TTCal and measurement sets.

```
MeasurementSet(name)
```

Open the measurement set at the given location. Assorted quantities that are commonly used by TTCal are automatically loaded and stored in fields.

### Memo178Beam

```
Memo178Beam <: BeamModel
```

This beam is based on the parametric fit to EM simulations presented in LWA memo 178 by Jayce Dowell.

[http://www.faculty.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwa/memo/lwa0178a.pdf]

### MuellerMatrix

```
immutable MuellerMatrix
```

This type represents a Mueller matrix.

```
MuellerMatrix(J::JonesMatrix)
```

Create a Mueller matrix from the given Jones matrix.

### Point



### PolarizationCalibration

```
immutable PolarizationCalibration <: Calibration
```

This type stores the information for calibrating the polarization of the interferometer. That is, it stores Jones matrices and flags for each antenna and each frequency channel.

```
PolarizationCalibration(Nant, Nfreq)
```

Create a calibration table for `Nant` antennas with `Nfreq` frequency channels where all the Jones matrices are initially set to the identity matrix.

### SineBeam

```
SineBeam <: BeamModel
```

This beam is azimuthally symmetric and independent of frequency. The gain of an individual dipole scales as $\sin(elevation)^\alpha$.

### Source

```
immutable Source
```

This type represents a radio source.

Each source is composed of one or more components.

### Spectrum

```
immutable Spectrum
```

These sources have a multi-component power-law spectrum such that:

\[     \log_{10} S = \log_{10} S_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n \log_{10}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^n \]

where $S$ is a Stokes parameter, and $\alpha_n$ is the list of spectral indices. At least one spectral index needs to be provided.

### StokesVector

```
immutable StokesVector
```

This type represents a Stokes vector.

\[ \begin{pmatrix}     I \\
    Q \\
    U \\
    V \\
\end{pmatrix} \]

### applycal!

```
applycal!(ms::MeasurementSet, calibration::Calibration;
          apply_to_corrected = false, force_imaging_columns = false)
```

Apply the calibration to the given measurement set.

**Arguments:**

  * `ms` - the measurement set to which the calibration will be applied
  * `calibration` - the calibration that will be applied

**Keyword Arguments:**

  * `apply_to_corrected` - if this is set to true, the calibration will be     applied to the CORRECTED_DATA column instead of the DATA column
  * `force_imaging_columns` - if this is set to true, the calibrated data     will be written to the CORRECTED_DATA column regardless of whether     or not the column already exists

### corrupt!

```
corrupt!(data::Array{Complex64,3}, cal::Calibration, ant1, ant2)
```

Corrupt the model data as if it had been observed with an instrument with the given calibration.

```
corrupt!(data::Array{Complex64,3}, flags::Array{Bool,3},
         cal::Calibration, ant1, ant2)
```

Corrupt the data as if it was observed with the given calibration.

### fitvis

```
fitvis(ms::MeasurementSet, direction::Direction;
       maxiter = 20, tolerance = 1e-3, minuvw = 0.0) -> l,m
```

Fit for the location of a point source near the given direction.

### gaincal

```
gaincal(ms::MeasurementSet, sources::Vector{Source}, beam::BeamModel;
        maxiter = 20, tolerance = 1e-3, minuvw = 0.0,
        reference_antenna = "1x", force_imaging_columns = false)
```

Solve for the interferometer's electronic gains.

**Arguments:**

  * `ms` - the measurement set from which to derive the calibration
  * `sources` - the list of points sources to use as the sky model
  * `beam` - the beam model

**Keyword Arguments:**

  * `maxiter` - the maximum number of Runge-Kutta steps to take on each     frequency channel
  * `tolerance` - the relative tolerance to use while checking to see if     more iterations are required
  * `minuvw` - the minimum baseline length (measured in wavelengths) to be     used during the calibration procedure
  * `reference_antenna` - a string containing the antenna number and polarization     whose phase will be chosen to be zero (eg. "14y" or "62x")
  * `force_imaging_columns` - if this is set to true, the MODEL_DATA column     will be created and populated with model visibilities even if it     doesn't already exist

### genvis

```
genvis(ms::MeasurementSet, sources, beam::BeamModel)
```

Generate model visibilities for the given list of sources and the given beam model.

No gridding is performed, so the runtime of this naive algorithm scales as $O(N_{base} \times N_{source})$.

### getspec

```
getspec(data, flags, l, m, u, v, w, Î½, ant1, ant2) -> Vector{HermitianJonesMatrix}
```

Compute the spectrum of a source located at $(l,m)$ in all of the polarized correlation products.

```
getspec(ms::MeasurementSet, direction::Direction;
        minuvw = 0.0) -> Vector{HermitianJonesMatrix}
```

This function extracts the spectrum in a given direction by means of an inverse discrete Fourier transform.

Note that no gridding is performed, so this does *not* use a fast Fourier transform. However, the inverse discrete Fourier transform *is* the least squares estimator for the flux in a given direction (if all baselines are weighted equally).

### peel!

```
peel!{T<:Calibration}(::Type{T},
                      ms::MeasurementSet,
                      sources::Vector{Source},
                      beam::BeamModel;
                      peeliter = 3,
                      maxiter = 20,
                      tolerance = 1e-3,
                      minuvw = 0.0)
```

Peel the given list of sources from the measurement set.

The type supplied as the first argument determines the manner in which the sources are peeled:

  * `PolarizationCalibration` - each source receives a full set of Jones matrices
  * `GainCalibration` - each source receives a full set of complex gains
  * `AmplitudeCalibration` - each source receives a full set of gain amplitudes

```
polcal(ms::MeasurementSet, sources::Vector{Source}, beam::BeamModel;

**Arguments:**

  * `ms` - the measurement set from which to derive the calibration
  * `sources` - the list of points sources to use as the sky model
  * `beam` - the beam model

**Keyword Arguments:**

  * `maxiter` - the maximum number of Runge-Kutta steps to take on each     frequency channel
